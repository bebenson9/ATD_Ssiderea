METADATA FOR Data_ATD_Ssiderea

coreid			full identification code of the core in the format Y-AA-BB-##-S
						where 	Y = country code (one country in current study)
								AA = two letter reef zone designation 
										IR = inner reef
										OR = outer reef
								BB = two letter site code
										BH = Basin Hill Shoals
										BS = Bache Shoals
										CR = Cheeca Rocks
										WW = West Washerwoman
										AR = Aligator Reef
										CF = Carysfort Reef
										ES = Eastern Sambo
										FR = Fowey Rocks
								## = unique core number
								S  = Siderastrea siderea (one species in current study)
						
histid			full identification code of the histology sample in the format BB-#
						where 	BB = two letter site code (see coreid)
								# = unique histology sample number

waypoint		GPS waypoint of colony

lat				latitudinal location of colony at time of core collection

long 			longitudinal location of colony at time of core collection 
							
corecol			date of core collection

histcol 		date of histology sample collection 

scanned			date of core CT scan

reefzone		reef zone where colony is located 
						where 	IR = inner reef
								OR = outer reef
					
site			two letter site code (see coreid)

gender 			colony gender based on gametes identified via light microscopy 
						where 	M = male
								F = female
								NA = no gametes identified

mrb 			identity of  most recently deposited band discernable at apex of core
						where 	HIGH = high density band at apex
								LOW = low density band at apex
								
tissue 			tissue thickness (mm) as mean of 6 points around core perimeter 

corelength		core length as given by tape measure (cm)

meanle5			mean annual linear extension rate (cm yr-1) for most recent 5 years

meanle			mean annual linear extension rate (cm yr-1) for entire core record

e1				intra-annual variation in extension, or the ratio of winter 
				to summer extension, as measured by CT scan band width in pixels
				
ATDp			apparent time difference as predicted by the Townsville model and based
				on measured core characteristics
				
ATDpc			ATDp constrained to fall between 0 and 12 months	


ATDot			observed apparent time difference in the most recent 5 years of growth in
				each core and measuring peak to peak using sea surface temperature data

ATDot_mrb		observed apparent time difference as calculated in only the most recent
				band in a core using sea surface temperature
				
ATDot_mrb_a		observed apparent time difference as calculated using only the most recent
				band in a core, adjusted to avoid "jumping" across 0-12 boundary relative 
				to ATDot; see ESM Section D
						cores affected: Y-IR-BS-67-S
										Y-OR-AR-05-S
										Y-OR-ES-44-S
	
ATDop			observed apparent time difference using 5 years per core and measuring 
				peak to peak using photosynthetically active radiation data	
				
														
ATDop_a			ATDop adjusted as needed to avoid "jumping" across 0-12 boundary relative
				to ATDot; see ESM Section D
						cores affected: Y-IR-BS-67-S
										Y-IR-BS-69-S
										Y-IR-BS-74-S					
										Y-OR-AR-05-S

ATDop_mrb		observed apparent time difference as calculated in only the most recent
				band in a core using photosynthetically active radiation data	


ATDot_mrb_a		observed apparent time difference as calculated using only the most recent
				band in a core, adjusted to avoid "jumping" across 0-12 boundary relative 
				to ATDop; see ESM Section D
